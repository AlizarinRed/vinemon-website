Their reason for remaining unchanged is due to how their 9-inch talons and ability to control any passerby into doing what it wants. It's theorized this might be why there's a particularly heavy owl theme within the many ruins of Fanoth.

Scientists have argued about whether or not to consider this an evolution, due to just being a GEARA with a spiked hula-hoop with an extra small gear petal. However, the small minority is the loudest, and so they remain classified as an evolutionary form.

Pokedex=Skruntank is a Fanothian Form of Skuntank. Skruntank has evolved its mask-like face into a fully functioning gas mask due to continued environmental adaptation. Because of this, its body has become far more heated from chemical reactions happening along its body, producing nuclear fallout. It's theorized they repel humans using their fallout in this way, as humans can't be near without suffering shorter lifespans. This Vinemon was first discovered by JUSTJICH!
